# README #

This is a simple app for exploring the structure of IEEE 754 floating point numbers.  A single floating point number is presented as a sequence of "bit buttons" that can be manipulated in several ways.  The resulting floating point value, as well as various meta-data are updated after every operation.

### What is this repository for? ###
